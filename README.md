# Car-Classification-KNN

Purpose: 
  1. Examine dataset about car classifications based on multiple parameters
  2. Use clustering classification to determine the ‘class’ of the car
  3. Apply KNN algorithm

Dataset:

Dataset is sourced from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository
Car Evaluation Database was derived from a simple hierarchical decision model
Source: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Car+Evaluation
Top line has been added to show the titles of the columns

I am using pandas, sklearn, numpy, matplotlib to work with this dataset

I used this project to determine the most accurate number of neighbours.


Conclusion:
The most efficient KNN value usually is 8
Produces about 94% accuracy
